Applications for video stream(s) preview and recording of video frames generated by
Miniscope hardware and/or common video cameras.

- __CamInfo.py__ - CLI script that enumerate all video sources (i.e. cameras) available on the PC where
it was launched and print out detailed information about each of them.
- __CamView.py__ - GUI application that allow you to select single video source from a
drop down list of all available sources and view the live video stream from it.
- __msView.py__ - GUI application that allow to use Miniscope device in a "view only" mode,
i.e. without recording any data. So far useful only for base-plating etc.

__FIXME: actual recording feature is not available yet.__

__NOTE:__ If you experiencing troubles/errors on your PC related to capturing video - try to locate
when the problem appears it by executing scripts in the *order* listed above.
