Applications for video stream previews and recording of video frames generated by
Miniscope hardware and/or common video cameras.

-   __CamInfo.py__ - CLI script that enumerate all video sources (i.e. cameras) available on the PC where it was launched and prints out detailed information about each of them.
-   __CamView.py__ - GUI application that allows you to select a single video source from a drop down list of all available sources and view the live video stream from it.
-   __msView.py__ - GUI application that allows you to use the Miniscope device in a "view only" mode, i.e. without recording any data. So far useful only for base-plating, etc.
-   __msCap.py__ - GUI application for data acquisition from Miniscope and/or any other arbitrary set of video sources.

__NOTE:__ If you experiencing troubles/errors on your PC related to capturing video - try to locate
when the problem appears by executing scripts in the *order* listed above.
